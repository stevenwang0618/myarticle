Examine d'Alembert-Lagrange method.  Let us begin with Newton's law of
motion applied to a system of $N$ particles. For the $i$th particle of
mass $m_i$ and inertial position $\vec{r}_i$, we have

\begin{equation}
  \vec{F}_i + \vec{R}_i - m_i \ddot{\vec{r}}_i = 0
\end{equation}

$\vec{F}_i$ is the impressed force and $\vec{R}_i$ is the constraint
force. Multiply virtual displacement $\delta \vec{r}_i$ and sum over
$i$. We obtain

 \begin{equation}
   \label{eq:dalembert-principle}
   \sum_{i=1}^{N}( \vec{F}_i + \vec{R}_i - m_i \ddot{\vec{r}}_i) \cdot \delta \vec{r}_i = 0
 \end{equation}

 the result is valid for arbitrary $\delta r$s; but now assume $\delta
 r$s satisfy the virtual constraint equations, that is,

\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:idealconstraints}
  \sum_{i=1}^N \vec{R}_i \cdot \delta \vec{r}_i = 0
\end{equation}

then we obtain
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:dalembert-principle-1}
  \sum_{i=1}^N(\vec{F}_i - m_i \ddot{\vec{r}}_i) \cdot \delta \vec{r}_i = 0,
\end{equation}

In terms to Cartesian coordinates, we have the form
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:dalembert-principle-cartesian}
  \sum_{k=1}^{3N} (F_k - m_k \ddot{x}_k)\delta x_k = 0.
\end{equation}

$\delta x$s satisfy $\sum_{k=1}^{3N}R_k \delta x_k = 0$.

\section{Lagrange's Equations}
\label{sec:lagrangeeom}

We start from d'Alembert Principle. 

\subsection{D'Alembert's Principle}
Let consider a system of $N$ particles and write the equation of motion for each particle in the form
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:dalembert}
  \mathbf{F}^{e}_i + \mathbf{F}^{c}_i - m_i\mathbf{\ddot{r}}_i = 0
\end{equation}
where $\mathbf{F}^{e}_i$ is the external force and $\mathbf{F}^{c}_i$ is the constraint force acting on the particle. As we know, $-m_i\mathbf{\ddot{r}}_i$ is the inertial force, acting on the $i$th particle, where $m_i$ is the constant mass and $\mathbf{\ddot{r}}_i$ is its acceleration relative to an inertial frame.

The total work done by all the forces in an arbitrary virtual displacement is 
%\begin{equation}

%\delta W = \sum_{i=1}^{3N}{ \left(\mathbf{F}^{e}_i + \mathbf{F}^{c}_i - m_i \mathbf{\ddot{r}}_i \right) \cdot \dr_i} = 0
%\end{equation}

If we now assume the $\mathbf{F}^{c}_i$ are workless constraint forces


A virtual displacement $\dr_i$ is an assumed infintesimal change of system coordinates occurring while time is held constant. It is called virtual rather than real since no actual displacement can take place without the passage of time.
\section{Variational Principle for Nonholonomic Systems}
\label{sec:variational}
Hamilton's Principle is viewed as an integrated form of D'Alembert's
principle in essence.

Conventionally, Hamilton's principle is not applicable to nonholonomic
system, since the varied path here is not the geometrical possible
path which conforms to the constraints. Of course, it is used in
holonomic system. But it seems that the only reason we use it in
holonomic system is it gives the same equations of motion as the ones
offered by D'Alembert's principle in a more convenient way.
