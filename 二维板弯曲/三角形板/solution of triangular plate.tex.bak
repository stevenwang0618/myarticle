\section{Introduction}
The lateral deflection in plain-plate problem is described by the equilibrium equation
    \begin{equation}\label{equation 1}                                       %Equation(1)
    \frac{\partial^{4}w}{\partial x^{4}}+ 2\frac{\partial^{4}w}{\partial x^{2} \partial y^{2}}+\frac{\partial^{4}w}{\partial y^{4}}=p(x,y)
    \end{equation}
where $ p(x,y)$ is a continuously distributed lateral load.
The general solution of the partial Equation (\ref{equation 1}) is given by
    \begin{equation}\label{equation 2}                                       %Equation(2)
    w(x,y)=w_{0}(x,y)+\varphi_{1}(x+iy)+\varphi_{2}(x-iy)+x[\psi_{1}(x+iy)+\psi_{2}(x-iy)]
    \end{equation}
where $w_{0}(x,y)$ is a particular solution of Equation (\ref{equation 1}) and $\varphi_{1}$,$\varphi_{2}$,$\psi_{1}$,$\psi_{2}$ are four arbitrary functions.
